# Goal

- **What**: Fulfilling life. A fulfilled life is one where you are happy, healthy, and productive in all aspects of life by your own standards.
- **How**: By managing your life effectively.
    - **How**: Identify, build, and maintain the pillars of life.

**Pillars** are the foundational elements of life that support your well-being and happiness.

## Potential Harms and Mitigation

The process of identifying, building, and maintaining the pillars of life can be overwhelming and stressful. It can also lead to feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt. It is important to be aware of these potential harms and to take steps to mitigate them. Here are some suggestions:

- **Take breaks**: It is important to take breaks from the process to avoid burnout. Take time to relax and recharge.
- **Be kind to yourself**: It is easy to be overly critical of yourself. Remember that you are doing your best and that you are not alone in this process.
- **Seek support**: If you are struggling, reach out to friends, family, or a professional for help. You do not have to go through this alone.
- **Be patient**: It takes time to build and maintain the pillars of life. Do not expect to see immediate results. Be patient with yourself and the process.
- **Be flexible**: The pillars of life are not set in stone. They can change over time. Be open to new ideas and experiences.
- **Be realistic**: It is important to set realistic goals and expectations for yourself. Do not expect to be perfect or to have everything figured out right away.
- **Be grateful**: It is easy to focus on the negative aspects of life. Take time to appreciate the good things in your life and to be grateful for what you have.
- **Be mindful**: It is important to be mindful of your thoughts, feelings, and actions. Pay attention to how you are feeling and what you are thinking. This will help you to identify areas where you can improve.
- **Be kind to others**: It is important to be kind to others as well as yourself. Treat others with respect and compassion. This will help you to build positive relationships with others.
- **Be open-minded**: It is important to be open-minded and to consider different perspectives. This will help you to learn and grow as a person.
- **Be honest**: It is important to be honest with yourself and others. This will help you to build trust and respect with others.

## Amazon's Leadership Principles

### Software

1. **Customer Obsession**: Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.
2. **Ownership**: Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job".
3. **Invent and Simplify**: Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here". As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.
4. **Are Right, A Lot**: Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.
5. **Learn and Be Curious**: Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.
6. **Hire and Develop the Best**: Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.
7. **Insist on the Highest Standards**: Leaders have relentlessly high standards - many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.
8. **Think Big**: Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.
9.  **Bias for Action**: Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.
10. **Frugality**: Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size or fixed expense.
11. **Earn Trust**: Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.
12. **Dive Deep**: Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.
13. **Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit**: Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.
14. **Deliver Results**: Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.
15. **Strive to be Earth’s Best Employer**: Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun. Leaders ask themselves: are my fellow employees growing? Are they empowered? Are they ready for what’s next? Leaders have a vision for and commitment to their employees’ personal success, whether that be at Amazon or elsewhere.
16. **Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility**: Leaders create more than just shareholder value. They invest in their team and look to benefit others. They understand that Amazon has responsibilities to the communities in which we operate and strive to be a good neighbor.

2. **Happiness Formula**: Introduce Haidt's formula for happiness: H = S + C + V (Happiness = Set point + Conditions + Voluntary activities). This formula suggests that while some aspects of happiness are genetic (set point) or circumstantial (conditions), a significant part comes from intentional activities (voluntary activities).
