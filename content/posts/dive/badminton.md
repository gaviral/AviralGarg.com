Today I learned about the different levels of badminton play. Here's a breakdown of the skills and knowledge required at each level:

## Levels of Play

### F3. Absolute Beginner:

Strengths: Enthusiasm for learning the sport.
Struggles with: Basic rules, racket grip, court dimensions, and fundamental strokes. Footwork is still not muscle memory and will resort to pure running around when pressured. Literally everything.

### F2. Beginner:

Strengths: Familiarity with basic rules, fundamental strokes (forehand, backhand). Holds correct grip more times then not, but may still slip up under pressure or in fast situations like drives.
Struggles with: Consistency, footwork, court coverage, and serving. Shot quality with most shots still going somewhere vaguely in the center. Lacks intentional thinking and will lift every serve, and most points are won on the basis of consistency.

### F1. Advanced Beginner:

Strengths: Consistency in basic strokes, developing footwork. Consistently is in the proper grip, albeit slowly. Taking the game more seriously, should have proper badminton shoes by now. Obsessed with trick shots. Points are beginning to be won intentionally.
Struggles with: Shot accuracy, serving, returning, executing/receiving cross-court shots. Can sometimes do a backhand clear or drop, but with poor quality/awkward form. Still struggling to adjust to different court conditions as well as fast/slow shuttlecocks.

### E3. Lower Intermediate:

Strengths: Proficiency in basic strokes, footwork, and serves. Is likely in the phase where they are stringing tension too high for ego (they will have realization for their more “appropriate” tension in Advanced intermediate). Gets away with cheeky shots if played with quality (flick serves, drive serves, cross nets/drops, a brute forced smash).
Struggles with: Shot selection, strategy, consistency in executing various shots like smashes, drop shots, and clears. Shot quality is lacking as well.

### E2. Intermediate:

Strengths: Improved shot selection, strategy, and consistency in executing various shots. Hallmark of intermediate player is consistent and quality backhand strokes from rear EXCEPT smash. This is also the stage where players will begin to realize their strengths and weaknesses, developing their own playstyle/preferred shots as well as gravitating towards a certain discipline (singles, doubles, mixed).
Struggles with: Advanced techniques, deception, reading opponents' play, and controlling the shuttle in high-pressure situations.

### E1. Advanced Intermediate:

Strengths: Mastery of intermediate techniques, strong court awareness, and tactical play. Will understand how to use the court more effectively, playing shots that are of varying lengths intentionally (tight net shot vs long net shot, dead zone vs to the corner, fast vs high lift). Beginning to understand the concept of playing shots to get shots.
Struggles with: High-pressure situations, maintaining stamina and speed throughout a match, and competing against higher-ranked players. Refining of techniques/ physicality is a must to go up further.

### D3. Lower Competitive:

Strengths: Irregular competition experience, begins experimenting with advanced techniques, strong court awareness, and tactical play. Attracts attention when visiting new clubs for queuing/social games.
Struggles with: Consistency in high-level competition, refining advanced techniques, and mental fortitude in high-pressure situations. May begin to feel they are plateauing skill wise and law of diminishing return starts to kick in (spending more time for smaller improvements).

### D2. Competitive:

Strengths: Deep understanding of strategy, tactics, and advanced techniques.
Struggles with: Consistency in international competitions, managing nerves in crucial situations, and competing against elite professionals. Typically are lacking in “all roundedness” (eg: has gotten to this level by being a really strong smasher but weak defense, etc.) and will need to work on fundamentals raising overall quality in all aspects of the game to advance further.

### D1. Advanced Competitive:

Strengths: Exceptional skill, technique, and athleticism. Can be considered varsity of colleges for stronger countries, or joining the national team for weaker countries. This is usually as far as most people will make it, unless they started as a kid with intention of going pro.
Struggles with: Consistency in high-pressure matches, maintaining a competitive edge, and breaking into the top international rankings. Time and experience is the key/limiting factor here to progress further.

### C3. Semi-Professional:

Strengths: Consistent high-ranking in regional or national tournaments, strong international competition experience. On national team for a strong country known for badminton.
Struggles with: Breaking into the top global rankings, maintaining consistency in international competitions, and competing against elite professionals.

### C2. Lower Professional:

Strengths: Consistent ranking within the top players, exceptional skill, technique, and athleticism.
Struggles with: Managing pressure at high-level events, maintaining a competitive edge, and consistently reaching the late stages of prestigious events. Needs to find their X factor (if they haven’t already) in order to proceed; can no longer rely on playing a solid basic game.

### C1. Professional:

Strengths: Outstanding skill, mental strength, and dedication to the sport. Is likely their full time job.
Struggles with: Consistently winning prestigious events, maintaining peak performance, and overcoming the pressure of high expectations.

### B3. Elite Professional:

Strengths: Exceptional skill, mental strength, and dedication to the sport.
Struggles with: Consistently reaching the finals or winning prestigious events, managing the pressure of high stakes, and maintaining peak performance.

### B2. Top 10 Professional:

Strengths: Outstanding skill, mental strength, and dedication to the sport.
Struggles with: Consistently winning prestigious events, managing the pressure of high stakes, and maintaining peak performance. Smaller variables begin to drastically affect their game, and optimization is key.

### B1. World-Class Professional:

Strengths: Winning or consistently reaching the finals of prestigious titles.
Struggles with: Maintaining a dominant position, managing the pressure of high stakes, and handling the expectations of fans and sponsors. On top of the existing pressures, realizing that everyone is out to get you (with fans and sponsors expecting you to continue dominating) begins to affect your mental.

### A3. Multiple World Champion:

Strengths: Winning multiple prestigious titles, consistently performing at the highest level, and maintaining dominance in the sport.
Struggles with: Handling immense pressure and expectations, managing off-court commitments, and maintaining peak performance over an extended period.

### A2. Badminton Legend:

Strengths: Outstanding career, multiple prestigious titles, and a significant impact on the sport of badminton.
Struggles with: Sustaining motivation, managing the transition to retirement or coaching, and dealing with the legacy of their career.

### A1. Greatest of All Time (GOAT):

Strengths: Unrivaled achievements, skill, and contributions to the sport; widely recognized as the best in the history of badminton.
Struggles with: Pressure to maintain a high level of performance, public scrutiny, and expectations to continue setting new records or milestones.
