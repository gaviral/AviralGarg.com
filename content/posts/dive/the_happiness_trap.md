## PART ONE

### WHY IS IT HARAD TO BE HAPPY?

#### 1. Life is Difficult

<!-- Being human hurts. In our short time on this planet, we’ll have many moments of marvel, wonder, and joy—but also many of angst, dread, and despair. We’ll know the highs of love, connection, and friendship—but also the lows of loneliness, rejection, and loss. We’ll experience the delights of success, victory, and achievement—but also the miseries of failure, defeat, and disappointment.
In other words: life is difficult. And if we live long enough, we’re all going to experience pain, stress, and suffering in many different forms. The problem is most of us don’t know how to deal effectively with this reality. We work hard to find happiness—but all too often, we fail; and even when we succeed, it’s usually short-lived, leaving us dissatisfied and wanting more.
So why is it so hard to be happy? I’m glad you asked. This book is based on a huge body of scientific research that shows we all easily get caught in a powerful psychological trap. We go through life holding on tightly to many unhelpful beliefs about happiness—ideas widely accepted because “everyone knows they are true.” And these beliefs seem to make good sense—which is why you encounter them in so many self-help books and articles. But unfortunately, these misleading ideas tend to create a vicious cycle in which the more we pursue happiness, the more we suffer. And this psychological trap is so well hidden, we don’t even realize we’re caught in it.
That’s the bad news.
The good news is there’s hope. We can learn how to quickly recognize we’re stuck in “the happiness trap”—and, more importantly, how to escape it. This book will give you the skills and knowledge to do so. It’s based on a powerful psychological model known as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), a science-based approach with over 3000 published studies that show its effectiveness.
ACT (pronounced as the word act) was developed in the United States in the mid-1980s by psychologist Steven C. Hayes and his colleagues Kelly Wilson and Kirk Strosahl. Since that time, it has spread around the globe. Today there are hundreds of thousands of psychologists, therapists, counselors, coaches, and doctors practicing ACT in dozens of different countries—from the United States, United Kingdom, and Uganda to India, Indonesia, and Iran.
One reason for the growing popularity of ACT is that it’s astoundingly effective in helping people with a wide range of problems. Those three thousand scientific studies I mentioned earlier cover everything from depression, addiction, and anxiety disorders to psychosis, chronic pain, and trauma. However, ACT is not just a treatment for psychological disorders; it is also used to help people adjust well to chronic illness and disability, and build meaningful, rewarding lives even in the face of serious ongoing health issues. And on top of all that, it’s widely used by the armed forces, emergency services, government departments, professional sports teams and Olympic athletes, businesses, hospitals, and schools—to enhance health and well-being, reduce stress, improve performance, and increase resilience.
Last but not least, we all know about the importance of eating healthy food, exercising regularly, and cultivating good relationships with others; these are foundational building blocks for health, happiness, and well-being. But how hard is it to actually do these things on an ongoing basis? Easy in theory, hard in practice, for most of us. Fortunately, ACT gives us all the tools and strategies we need to break bad habits, overcome procrastination, motivate ourselves to start and maintain healthy new behaviors, and build better relationships with the people in our life. Shortly we’ll look at how ACT achieves this, but first let’s consider… -->
