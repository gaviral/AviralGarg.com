Today I learned about climbing! I went to a climbing gym for the first time and had a blast. I learned a lot about the sport and the different levels of climbing. With some internet research, I also learned about the different types of climbing, including top-rope climbing, lead climbing, and bouldering. I'm excited to continue learning and improving my climbing skills!

Here is what I learned about the different levels of indoor rock climbing:
