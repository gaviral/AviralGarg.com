## Creating a nesting components

- building blocks of React
- A piece of the UI with its own:
    - logic
    - appearance
- Can be as small as a button or as large as a page.
- React components are JavaScript functions that return markup.

```jsx
function MyButton() {
    return (
        <button>
            Click Me!
        </button>
    );
}
```

After declaring this button component, we can nest it inside of another component.

```jsx
export default function MyApp() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Welcome to my app!</h1>
            <MyButton />
        </div>
    );
}
```

|                | React Component | HTML Tag   |
|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Appearance** | `<MyButton />`  | `<button>` |
| first letter   | Capitalized     | Lowercase  |
