## The Unknown Third Giant

<!-- 
YOUTH: A moment ago, you used the words “another philosophy,” but I’ve
heard that your specialty is in Greek philosophy.

PHILOSOPHER: Yes, Greek philosophy has been central to my life ever since I was
a teenager. The great intellectual gures: Socrates, Plato, Aristotle. I am
translating a work by Plato at the moment, and I expect to spend the rest of my
life studying classical Greek thought.

YOUTH: Well, then what is this “other philosophy”?

PHILOSOPHER: It is a completely new school of psychology that was established
by the Austrian psychiatrist Alfred Adler at the beginning of the twentieth
century. It is generally referred to as Adlerian psychology.

YOUTH: Huh. I never would have imagined that a specialist in Greek philosophy
would be interested in psychology.

PHILOSOPHER: I’m not very familiar with paths taken by other schools of
psychology. However, I think it is fair to say that Adlerian psychology is clearly
in line with Greek philosophy, and that it is a proper eld of study.

YOUTH: I have a passing knowledge of the psychology of Freud and Jung. A
fascinating eld.

PHILOSOPHER: Yes, Freud and Jung are both renowned. Adler was one of the
original core members of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, which was led by 
Freud. His ideas were counter to Freud’s, and he split from the group and
proposed an “individual psychology” based on his own original theories.
