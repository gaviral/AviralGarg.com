# Adler's Approach to Psychology

Alfred Adler's approach to psychology, forming one of the pillars alongside Freud and Jung, is known for its focus on individual psychology. Here are the key aspects:

## Inferiority Complex

Adler believed that a sense of inferiority drives people's behavior. He argued that feelings of inadequacy, often rooted in childhood, motivate individuals to overcome challenges and strive for superiority.

## Social Interest

A unique aspect of Adler's theory is the emphasis on social interest, or 'Gemeinschaftsgef√ºhl'. He viewed this as an innate potential to cooperate with others for societal betterment. According to Adler, a well-adjusted individual displays a strong sense of social interest.

## Holistic View of the Individual

Adler saw each person as an integrated whole. He believed that understanding someone requires looking at their lifestyle, which includes their perceptions, interactions, and goals.

## Birth Order

Adler introduced the concept that birth order within a family can influence personality development. For example, firstborns may have different traits compared to middle or youngest children.

## Creative Power

Adler emphasized the individual's creative power to shape their personality and destiny. Unlike Freud, who stressed the deterministic role of unconscious drives, Adler focused on conscious action and choice.

## Final Thoughts

Adler's ideas have deeply influenced various areas like therapy, education, and parenting. His focus on social elements and individual agency marked a significant departure from the more internal focus of Freud and Jung.
