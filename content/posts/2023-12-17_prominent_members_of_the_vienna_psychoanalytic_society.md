The Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, founded by Sigmund Freud in 1902, was an influential organization in the early development of psychoanalysis. While it had many members over the years, some of the most popular and prominent members, in addition to Freud himself, included:

## Carl Jung

Carl Gustav Jung was a Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who was initially a close associate of Freud. However, he later developed his own school of psychology called Analytical Psychology, which diverged from Freud's psychoanalysis.

## Alfred Adler

Alfred Adler was an Austrian medical doctor and psychotherapist who was another early member of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society. He is best known for his development of Individual Psychology, which focused on the importance of social factors and personal striving in human psychology.

## Wilhelm Reich

Wilhelm Reich was an Austrian psychoanalyst who was known for his work on character analysis and the concept of "orgone energy." He later became controversial and was expelled from the psychoanalytic movement.

## Otto Rank

Otto Rank was another prominent member of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society and made significant contributions to the understanding of birth trauma and the psychology of creativity. He eventually had a falling out with Freud and left the psychoanalytic movement.

## Anna Freud

Anna Freud, the daughter of Sigmund Freud, was a prominent psychoanalyst in her own right. She made important contributions to the field of child psychoanalysis and is known for her work on defense mechanisms.

## Ernest Jones

Ernest Jones was a Welsh neurologist and psychoanalyst who played a key role in popularizing psychoanalysis in the English-speaking world. He was also one of Freud's earliest and closest followers.

These are just a few of the notable members of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society. The society was a hub for intellectual exchange and the development of psychoanalytic ideas during its early years, and it had a lasting impact on the field of psychology and psychotherapy.
