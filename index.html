- **DSA**
    - **Intro**
        - **Problem Solving**
            - **Problem**
                - **Definition**:
                    - Question w/ initially **unknown solution method**
                    - Initial state: **Cluelessness** (Expected/Natural)
                - **Contrast: "Exercise"**
                    - Solution **method is known** upfront
                        - *Example*: Large number multiplication (uses grade school arithmetic)
                    - Lacks **method mystery**
                    - May be time-consuming/error-prone, but *how* is clear
                - **Approach**
                    - Requires: Sustained **Investigation**
                    - Mechanism: Deploying **Algorithm Design Strategies** (Computational Problem-Solving Strategies)
                        - **Domain-Specific** (e.g., Math, Science, Computational)
                        - **Computational Strategies (Primary)**
                            - **Brute Force**
                            - **Decrease & Conquer**
                            - **Divide & Conquer**
                            - **Transform & Conquer**
        - **Coding Fluency**
            - Ability to **fluently transform** designed algorithm into **working code**
            - Corresponds to **Part 2** of Ideal Interview (Code Implementation)
            - Developed via **repetitive use** of **coding patterns** for speed.
    - **Technical Interview**
        - **Goal**: Test ability on **unseen problems**
            - Assess **Problem Solving** (Algorithm Design)
            - Assess **Coding Skills** (Implementation)
        - **Process**:
            - Given **unseen problem**
            - Candidate deploys **Algorithm Design Strategies**
            - Result: Design **correct** & **efficient** algorithm
        - **Structure**:
            - **Part 1**: Design Algorithm (**Problem Solving**)
            - **Part 2**: Code Algorithm (**Coding Fluency**)
        - **Ideal vs. Real Tension**
            - **Ideal**: Allows time for **sustained investigation**.
            - **Real**: **Timed test** -> Causes **anxiety** (like math tests).
                - **Resolving Tension (Approaches)**
                    - **1. Memorization**
                        - **Method**: Memorize all (1700+) solutions -> Treat problems as exercises (hash table lookup).
                        - **Drawbacks**:
                            - **Impractical**: Too many questions, requires excessive time.
                            - **Fails on Unseen**: Companies (e.g., Google) use novel questions -> Risk of "brain freeze". (Prepares for best case, not worst).
                            - **No Skill Growth**: Doesn't improve engineering fundamentals; waste of prep time.
                    - **2. Develop Problem Solving (Recommended Approach)**
                        - **Goal**: Become a better **problem solver**.
                        - **Benefits**:
                            - Develops **Inner Confidence**: Antidote to anxiety through practice on unseen problems. (Prevents "brain freeze")
                            - Improves **Engineering Skills**: Solidifies fundamentals, useful on the job.
                        - **Method**:
                            - Practice solving **unseen** questions.
                            - Exposure to **popular** interview questions.
                            - Cluster questions by **Coding Patterns**.
                                - **Definition**: Similar code structure/logic for related problems.
                                - **Benefit**: Reinforces patterns -> Faster, non-scratch coding during implementation.
                        - **Mindset Changes Required**:
                            - **Increase Concentration Time**:
                                - Resist quick lookups (5-10 min).
                                - Spend **significant time** (1-1.5 hrs min, potentially more) on *one* problem.
                                - If stuck: Break, sleep on it, revisit.
                                - If still stuck: Use **minimal hints**, not full solutions.
                            - **Embrace Failure & Iteration**:
                                - Expect **dead ends** when trying strategies.
                                - Backtrack & try other paths (nature of investigation).
                                - **Don't get discouraged** by failure.
                                - **Learn** from failed attempts ("Why didn't this work?").
                                - Dead ends can be **stepping stones** to optimal solutions.
                                - *Analogy*: Hiking - wrong trails lead to backtracking, finding new paths to the peak.
                            - **Positive Emotional Attitude**:
                                - Towards **unseen questions**.
                                - *Analogy*: Problem Solving ≈ Hiking/Exploring (unknown, getting lost is part of it) vs. Exercises ≈ Gym (repetitive).
                        - **Recommended Study Strategy**:
                            - **First Pass (New Problem)**:
                                - Focus: **Problem Solving** ONLY.
                                - Ignore time constraints initially (lengthy encounter expected).
                                - **AVOID** looking up solutions -> Build problem-solving muscles.
                            - **Subsequent Passes (Revisiting)**:
                                - Focus: **Coding Fluency**.
                                - Goal: Implement known algorithm **quickly** (no mystery).
                        - **Interview Behavior**:
                            - Even for familiar problems (exercises): **Show problem-solving path** to interviewer.
                            - Do not just retrieve solution from memory.
    - **Sorting**
        - **Focus**:
            - Apply **Algorithm Design Strategies** to actual interview problems (sorting context)
            - **Code** the resulting algorithms
